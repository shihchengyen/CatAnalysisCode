Change Log for the Cat Directory

September 23, 2004
    Changed the constructors for both the responsiveness and sparsity classes to include the SessionDirs 
    and Number for easy use of the get function. The plus functions were changed for the same reason. The 
    plot functions were changed to accomidate Heterogeneity calculations for Pairs, IntraGroup and InterGroup.

    Cat/@responsiveness/plot and heterogeneity
    Added a 'Bar' input to plot the responsiveness values in decending order for each group. Also modified the 
    heterogeneity function to account for the 'Bar' input. The output under 'Bar' is a matrix of responsiveness 
    values for each group.
